### Introduction 

Hello all.  My name's Fritz, and I'm a senior CSE major from Pittsburgh, PA.  I'm taking this course from my family home in Pittsburgh, and I will be working simultaneously as a full time remote intern for Prudentia Group, LLC in Jersey City, NJ.  My main focus within Computer Science is database development, so I think I will learn a lot of useful information in this class.  I competed in the high hurdles and triple jump for Lehigh's track & field team from 2014-2017, though I've since retired.  I enjoy mountain biking and being outdoors in general.  I dislike complaining, bad drivers, and enclosed spaces.  I look forward to getting to know everyone a bit more while learning an important skill.

In the modern era of information overload, there are constantly stories emerging that border on conspiracy theories.  One such conspiracy theory is that of the #Plandemic: the idea that someone started the Covid-19 epidemic with intent. This is a visualization of tweets that mention this conspiracy theory.
