## FRITZ'S PORTFOLIO PAGE

### Introduction

Hello all.  My name's Fritz, and I'm a senior CSE major from Pittsburgh, PA.  I'm taking this course from my family home in Pittsburgh, and I will be working simultaneously as a full time remote intern for Prudentia Group, LLC in Jersey City, NJ.  My main focus within Computer Science is database development, so I think I will learn a lot of useful information in this class.  I competed in the high hurdles and triple jump for Lehigh's track & field team from 2014-2017, though I've since retired.  I enjoy mountain biking and being outdoors in general.  I dislike complaining, bad drivers, and enclosed spaces.  I look forward to getting to know everyone a bit more while learning an important skill.
